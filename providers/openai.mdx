# OpenAI

Use GPT-4.1, o3, o4-mini, and other OpenAI models.

## Setup

1. Get an API key at [platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. In Pawz → **Settings → Providers** → **Add Provider** → **OpenAI**
3. Paste your API key

## Configuration

| Setting | Default |
|---------|---------|
| Base URL | `https://api.openai.com/v1` |
| API key | Required |
| Default model | — |

## Models

| Model | Context | Best for |
|-------|---------|----------|
| `gpt-4.1` | 1M | Best overall — fast, smart, multimodal |
| `gpt-4.1-mini` | 1M | Great balance of speed and cost |
| `gpt-4.1-nano` | 1M | Ultra-cheap for simple tasks |
| `o3` | 200K | Complex reasoning and multi-step analysis |
| `o4-mini` | 200K | Reasoning at lower cost |

## Prefix routing

Model names starting with `gpt*`, `o1*`, `o3*`, or `o4*` auto-route to OpenAI. You can also set per-agent model overrides in **Settings → Advanced**.

## Streaming

OpenAI responses stream via Server-Sent Events (SSE). Pawz processes tokens as they arrive — you'll see text appear word-by-word in the chat. Token usage (input/output) is reported at the end of each stream.

## Tool calling

OpenAI models support native function/tool calling. When an agent has tools enabled, Pawz sends tool definitions in the `tools` parameter and handles `tool_calls` responses automatically. The Human-in-the-Loop approval flow applies to any side-effect tools.

## Tips

:::tip
- **Use `gpt-4.1-nano` as your `cheap_model`** — it's extremely affordable and handles simple queries well. Pair it with `auto_tier` to save 50%+ on token costs.
- **Prompt caching** — OpenAI caches repeated prompt prefixes. Keep your system prompts consistent across sessions to benefit from cached input pricing.
- **Set a daily budget** — OpenAI models can get expensive with long conversations. Use **Settings → Advanced → Daily budget** to cap spending.
- **Context window** — GPT-4.1 supports 1M tokens, but Pawz defaults to a conservative 32K limit per agent. Increase in **Settings → Advanced → Context Window** if needed.
