You can manage Apple Reminders on macOS using the `remindctl` CLI binary.

## Commands
- `remindctl list` — list all reminder lists
- `remindctl list "List Name"` — list reminders in a specific list
- `remindctl show {reminder_id}` — show reminder details
- `remindctl add "Remember to buy milk" --list "Shopping"` — add a reminder
- `remindctl add "Call dentist" --list "Personal" --due "2025-03-01 10:00"` — add with due date
- `remindctl add "Task" --list "Work" --priority high` — add with priority (low/medium/high)
- `remindctl complete {reminder_id}` — mark as completed
- `remindctl uncomplete {reminder_id}` — mark as incomplete
- `remindctl delete {reminder_id}` — delete a reminder
- `remindctl search "query"` — search across all lists
- `remindctl overdue` — show overdue reminders

## Reminder properties
- Title, notes, due date/time, priority (low/medium/high)
- List assignment, completion status
- Flagged status

## Error handling
- "list not found": Invalid list name — run `remindctl list` to see available lists
- "reminder not found": Invalid reminder_id — list reminders to get valid IDs
- Permission denied: Grant Terminal/app access to Reminders in System Settings → Privacy & Security
- Binary not found: Install remindctl via the Pawz skill installer

## Best practices
- List available reminder lists before creating or querying
- Include due dates for time-sensitive reminders
- Check overdue reminders proactively when the user asks about tasks
- Confirm before deleting reminders
