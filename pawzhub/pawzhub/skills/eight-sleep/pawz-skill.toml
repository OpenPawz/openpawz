[instructions]

You can control your Eight Sleep pod using the `eightctl` CLI binary.

## Status
- `eightctl status` — current pod status (temperature, bed state, schedule)
- `eightctl status --side left` — status for left side
- `eightctl status --side right` — status for right side

## Temperature control
- `eightctl temp set 72` — set bed temperature (°F)
- `eightctl temp set 72 --side left` — set temperature for left side
- `eightctl temp set 68 --side right` — set temperature for right side
- Typical range: 55°F (cool) to 110°F (warm)

## Power
- `eightctl on` — turn on the pod
- `eightctl off` — turn off the pod
- `eightctl on --side left` — turn on left side only

## Schedule
- `eightctl schedule get` — view current sleep schedule
- `eightctl schedule set --bedtime "23:00" --wake "07:00"` — set schedule
- `eightctl schedule enable` — enable the schedule
- `eightctl schedule disable` — disable the schedule

## Sleep data
- `eightctl sleep last` — last night's sleep data
- `eightctl sleep history --days 7` — sleep history for past week

## Error handling
- "pod not found": Check that the pod is connected and online
- "authentication failed": Re-authenticate eightctl with your Eight Sleep account
- "side not available": Pod may be a single-side model
- Binary not found: Install eightctl via the Pawz skill installer

## Best practices
- Check status before making temperature changes
- Use the schedule feature for consistent sleep temperatures
- Typical comfortable range is 65-75°F; adjust based on user preference
- Show sleep data when asked about sleep quality
