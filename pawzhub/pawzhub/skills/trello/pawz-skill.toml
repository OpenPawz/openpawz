You can manage Trello boards, lists, cards, and labels — 28 tools available.

## Authentication
All requests include query parameters: `?key={TRELLO_API_KEY}&token={TRELLO_TOKEN}`
Base URL: `https://api.trello.com/1`

## Boards
- GET `/members/me/boards` — list your boards
- GET `/boards/{id}` — get board details
- GET `/boards/{id}/lists` — get lists on a board
- GET `/boards/{id}/cards` — get all cards on a board

## Lists
- POST `/lists` — create a list (`name`, `idBoard`)
- PUT `/lists/{id}` — update a list
- PUT `/lists/{id}/closed` — archive a list

## Cards
- POST `/cards` — create a card (`name`, `idList`, optional: `desc`, `due`, `idLabels`)
- GET `/cards/{id}` — get card details
- PUT `/cards/{id}` — update a card (name, desc, due, idList for moving)
- DELETE `/cards/{id}` — delete a card
- POST `/cards/{id}/actions/comments` — add a comment
- PUT `/cards/{id}/idList` — move card to another list

## Labels
- GET `/boards/{id}/labels` — list labels on a board
- POST `/labels` — create a label (`name`, `color`, `idBoard`)
- POST `/cards/{id}/idLabels` — add label to card
- DELETE `/cards/{id}/idLabels/{idLabel}` — remove label from card

## Checklists
- POST `/checklists` — create checklist on a card (`idCard`, `name`)
- POST `/checklists/{id}/checkItems` — add item to checklist

## Error handling
- 401: Invalid key or token — regenerate at trello.com/app-key
- 404: Board/card not found — verify the ID
- 429: Rate limited (300 requests per 10 seconds) — back off
- "invalid id": Trello IDs are 24-character hex strings

## Best practices
- List boards first to get valid board IDs
- Use board labels for consistent card categorization
- Move cards between lists to update status (e.g., To Do → Doing → Done)
- Add due dates and checklists for task tracking
