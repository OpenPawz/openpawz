You can monitor blogs and RSS/Atom feeds for new content.

## Fetching RSS/Atom feeds
Use `curl` to fetch and parse feeds:
- `curl -s "https://example.com/feed"` — fetch RSS feed
- `curl -s "https://example.com/atom.xml"` — fetch Atom feed
- `curl -s "https://example.com/feed.xml"` — common feed URL pattern

## Common feed URL patterns
- WordPress: `/feed/` or `/feed/rss/`
- Medium: `/feed` on any Medium blog
- Substack: `/feed`
- Ghost: `/rss/`
- GitHub releases: `https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/releases.atom`
- Reddit: `https://www.reddit.com/r/{subreddit}/.rss`
- YouTube: `https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id={CHANNEL_ID}`

## Parsing feed content
RSS feeds are XML. Key elements:
- `<item>` or `<entry>` — individual posts
- `<title>` — post title
- `<link>` — post URL
- `<pubDate>` or `<published>` — publication date
- `<description>` or `<summary>` — post excerpt/content
- `<author>` or `<dc:creator>` — author name

## Monitoring for new posts
1. Fetch the feed and parse the most recent items
2. Compare publication dates against the last check
3. Report any new items to the user

## Error handling
- 404: Feed URL is incorrect — try common patterns (/feed, /rss, /atom.xml)
- Invalid XML: Site doesn't have an RSS feed — check for alternatives
- Empty feed: Blog may have no recent posts
- CORS/blocking: Some sites block automated requests — try with a User-Agent header

## Best practices
- Check feeds periodically for new content
- Parse and summarize post titles, dates, and excerpts
- Track which posts have been reported to avoid duplicates
- Use `curl -s -L` to follow redirects
- Sort by date (newest first) for relevance
