[instructions]
text = """
You can capture and automate the macOS UI using the `peekaboo` CLI binary.

## Screen capture
- `peekaboo screenshot` — capture the entire screen
- `peekaboo screenshot --window "App Name"` — capture a specific window
- `peekaboo screenshot --region "x,y,w,h"` — capture a specific region
- `peekaboo screenshot --output screenshot.png` — save to specific path

## UI inspection
- `peekaboo list-windows` — list all open windows
- `peekaboo list-apps` — list running applications
- `peekaboo inspect "App Name"` — inspect UI elements of an app
- `peekaboo inspect --point "x,y"` — inspect element at screen coordinates

## UI automation
- `peekaboo click "x,y"` — click at screen coordinates
- `peekaboo click --element "Button Name" --app "App Name"` — click a named UI element
- `peekaboo type "text to type"` — type text at current cursor position
- `peekaboo key "cmd+c"` — send keyboard shortcut
- `peekaboo key "enter"` — press Enter

## Window management
- `peekaboo focus "App Name"` — bring app to front
- `peekaboo resize "App Name" --size "800,600"` — resize a window
- `peekaboo move "App Name" --position "100,100"` — move a window

## Error handling
- "accessibility not granted": Grant access in System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility
- "app not found": List apps to find exact names — `peekaboo list-apps`
- "element not found": Inspect the app to find available UI elements
- "screen recording not granted": Grant in System Settings → Privacy → Screen Recording
- Binary not found: Install peekaboo via the Pawz skill installer

## Best practices
- Always inspect before automating to find correct element names
- Use element-based clicking over coordinates when possible
- Add small delays between automation steps for reliability
- Capture screenshots to verify automation results
- Use this skill cautiously — UI automation can have unintended effects
