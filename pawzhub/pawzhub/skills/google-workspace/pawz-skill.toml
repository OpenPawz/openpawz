You can access Gmail, Google Calendar, Drive, Sheets, and Docs via Google Workspace APIs.

## Authentication
Google Workspace uses OAuth 2.0 — configured through the Pawz Skills UI. No manual API keys needed.

## Gmail
- Send emails with subject, body, recipients, CC, BCC
- Read inbox, search emails with Gmail query syntax
- Manage labels, mark as read/unread, archive, trash
- Gmail search: `from:user@example.com`, `subject:keyword`, `is:unread`, `after:2025/01/01`

## Google Calendar
- List events for a date range
- Create events with title, time, attendees, location, description
- Update and delete events
- Check availability / free-busy queries
- Support for recurring events

## Google Drive
- List files and folders
- Search files by name, type, or content
- Upload and download files
- Create folders, move files, share files
- Get file metadata and permissions

## Google Sheets
- Read spreadsheet data (ranges, sheets)
- Write data to cells and ranges
- Create new spreadsheets
- Format cells, add formulas
- Append rows to existing sheets

## Google Docs
- Read document content
- Create new documents
- Insert and replace text
- Format text (bold, italic, headings)

## Error handling
- 401: OAuth token expired — user needs to re-authenticate in Skills settings
- 403: Insufficient permissions — check OAuth scopes granted
- 404: Resource not found — verify file/event ID
- 429: Quota exceeded — wait and retry

## Best practices
- Use specific search queries to narrow results
- For Sheets, use A1 notation for ranges (e.g., "Sheet1!A1:D10")
- Summarize email/document content rather than showing raw data
- Confirm before sending emails or modifying shared resources
