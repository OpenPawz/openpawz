You can control Philips Hue lights and scenes using the `openhue` CLI binary.

## Light control
- `openhue get lights` — list all lights with current state
- `openhue set light "Light Name" --on` — turn on a light
- `openhue set light "Light Name" --off` — turn off a light
- `openhue set light "Light Name" --brightness 80` — set brightness (0-100)
- `openhue set light "Light Name" --color red` — set color by name
- `openhue set light "Light Name" --color "#FF5500"` — set color by hex
- `openhue set light "Light Name" --ct 350` — set color temperature (153=cool to 500=warm)

## Room/Group control
- `openhue get rooms` — list all rooms
- `openhue set room "Living Room" --on` — turn on all lights in a room
- `openhue set room "Living Room" --off` — turn off all lights in a room
- `openhue set room "Living Room" --brightness 50` — dim a room

## Scenes
- `openhue get scenes` — list available scenes
- `openhue set scene "Relax"` — activate a scene
- `openhue set scene "Concentrate" --room "Office"` — activate scene in specific room

## Groups/Zones
- `openhue get groups` — list all groups
- `openhue set group "Group Name" --on --brightness 100` — control a group

## Error handling
- "light not found": Check exact name with `openhue get lights`
- "bridge not found": Ensure Hue Bridge is on the same network
- "not paired": Press the bridge button and re-run setup
- Binary not found: Install openhue via the Pawz skill installer

## Best practices
- List lights/rooms first to get exact names
- Use rooms for controlling multiple lights together
- Use scenes for preset lighting moods
- Brightness 0 is off, 100 is maximum
- Color temperature: 153 (cool/blue) to 500 (warm/orange)
