[instructions]
text = """
You can capture frames from IP cameras using the `camsnap` CLI binary.

## Capture frames
- `camsnap capture` — capture a frame from the default camera
- `camsnap capture --camera "front_door"` — capture from a named camera
- `camsnap capture --camera "backyard" --output snapshot.jpg` — save to specific file
- `camsnap capture --all` — capture from all configured cameras

## Camera management
- `camsnap list` — list all configured cameras
- `camsnap status` — show camera connection status
- `camsnap add "camera_name" --url "rtsp://192.168.1.100:554/stream"` — add a camera
- `camsnap remove "camera_name"` — remove a camera

## Stream URLs
Common formats:
- RTSP: `rtsp://user:pass@192.168.1.100:554/stream1`
- HTTP: `http://192.168.1.100/snap.jpg`
- ONVIF: auto-discovered on local network

## Output
- Default output: JPEG image saved to current directory
- Images include timestamp metadata
- Can specify output directory with `--output-dir`

## Error handling
- "camera not found": List cameras to verify name — `camsnap list`
- "connection refused": Camera is offline or URL is incorrect
- "authentication failed": Check camera username/password in URL
- "timeout": Camera is not responding — check network connectivity
- Binary not found: Install camsnap via the Pawz skill installer

## Best practices
- List cameras first to see available feeds
- Check camera status before capturing to avoid timeout errors
- Use descriptive camera names (front_door, garage, backyard)
- Captured images can be analyzed or shared with the user
- For security monitoring, capture at regular intervals
