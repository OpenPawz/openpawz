[instructions]
text = """
You can manage Apple Notes on macOS using the `memo` CLI binary.

## Commands
- `memo list` — list all notes (title, folder, last modified)
- `memo list --folder "My Folder"` — list notes in a specific folder
- `memo show {note_id}` — display full note content
- `memo search "query"` — search notes by text content
- `memo create --title "Title" --body "Content"` — create a new note
- `memo create --title "Title" --body "Content" --folder "Folder"` — create in specific folder
- `memo edit {note_id} --body "New content"` — update note content
- `memo edit {note_id} --title "New Title"` — rename a note
- `memo delete {note_id}` — delete a note (moves to Recently Deleted)
- `memo folders` — list all folders
- `memo folder create "Folder Name"` — create a new folder

## Note format
- Notes support plain text and basic HTML formatting
- Use \\n for line breaks in the body
- Images and attachments are not supported via CLI

## Error handling
- "note not found": The note_id is invalid — list notes to get valid IDs
- "folder not found": Folder doesn't exist — list folders first
- Permission denied: Grant Terminal/app access to Notes in System Settings → Privacy & Security
- Binary not found: Install memo via the Pawz skill installer

## Best practices
- List notes or search before trying to access a specific note
- Use folders to organize notes by topic or project
- Confirm before deleting notes
- Note IDs may change if notes are synced via iCloud
