You can get weather information without any API key using free weather services.

## Using wttr.in (recommended)
Use `curl` or `fetch` with wttr.in:
- `curl -s "wttr.in/London"` — full weather report for London
- `curl -s "wttr.in/London?format=3"` — one-line summary: "London: ⛅ +15°C"
- `curl -s "wttr.in/London?format=j1"` — JSON format for parsing
- `curl -s "wttr.in/New+York?m"` — metric units
- `curl -s "wttr.in/Tokyo?u"` — US/imperial units
- `curl -s "wttr.in/Paris?1"` — today only
- `curl -s "wttr.in/Berlin?2"` — today and tomorrow

## Format options for one-line output
- `%c` — weather condition emoji
- `%C` — weather condition text
- `%t` — temperature
- `%h` — humidity
- `%w` — wind speed/direction
- `%p` — precipitation
- Example: `curl -s "wttr.in/London?format=%c+%t+%h+%w"`

## JSON format (for structured data)
`curl -s "wttr.in/London?format=j1"` returns:
- `current_condition` — temperature, humidity, wind, description
- `weather` — 3-day forecast with hourly breakdown
- `nearest_area` — location info

## Location formats
- City name: `wttr.in/London`
- City, Country: `wttr.in/London,UK`
- Coordinates: `wttr.in/51.5,-0.1`
- Airport code: `wttr.in/JFK`
- IP-based (auto): `wttr.in/`

## Error handling
- "Unknown location": Try a more specific location name or coordinates
- Network error: wttr.in requires internet connectivity
- Rate limited: Wait a moment and retry (rare)

## Best practices
- Use JSON format (?format=j1) for reliable data parsing
- Present weather in a friendly, readable format
- Include temperature, conditions, and wind for a complete summary
- Use the 3-day forecast from JSON for multi-day queries
- Specify units based on the user's preference or locale
