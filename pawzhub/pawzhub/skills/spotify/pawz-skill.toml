- `spotify_player playback previous` — go to previous track
- `spotify_player playback shuffle` — toggle shuffle
- `spotify_player playback repeat` — cycle repeat mode (off/track/context)
- `spotify_player playback volume 75` — set volume (0-100)
- `spotify_player playback seek 30` — seek to 30 seconds

## Now playing
- `spotify_player get key playback` — get current playback state (track, artist, progress)

## Search
- `spotify_player search "song name"` — search tracks
- `spotify_player search "artist name" --type artist` — search artists
- `spotify_player search "album name" --type album` — search albums
- `spotify_player search "playlist name" --type playlist` — search playlists

## Play specific content

## Library
- `spotify_player list --type liked` — list liked songs
- `spotify_player list --type playlist` — list user playlists

## Error handling
- "No active device": Open Spotify on a device first
- "Not authenticated": Re-authenticate spotify_player with your Spotify account
- "Premium required": Some playback controls require Spotify Premium
- Binary not found: Install spotify_player via the Pawz skill installer

## Best practices
- Check current playback state before making changes
- Search for tracks to confirm the right song before playing
- Use playlist or album play for continuous listening
- Show track name and artist when reporting now playing
