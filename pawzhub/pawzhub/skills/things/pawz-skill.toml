You can manage Things 3 tasks on macOS using the `things` CLI binary.

## Commands
- `things inbox` — list tasks in the Inbox
- `things today` — list tasks scheduled for today
- `things upcoming` — list upcoming scheduled tasks
- `things anytime` — list tasks without a specific date
- `things someday` — list someday tasks
- `things completed` — list completed tasks
- `things projects` — list all projects
- `things project "Project Name"` — list tasks in a project
- `things areas` — list all areas
- `things tags` — list all tags
- `things search "query"` — search tasks by title/notes
- `things add "Task title"` — create a new task in Inbox
- `things add "Task" --project "Project" --when today --tags "tag1,tag2"` — create with details
- `things add "Task" --deadline "2025-03-01"` — create with deadline
- `things add "Task" --checklist "Step 1,Step 2,Step 3"` — create with checklist
- `things complete {task_id}` — mark task as complete
- `things cancel {task_id}` — cancel a task
- `things move {task_id} --to "Project Name"` — move to a project

## Task properties
- Title, notes, when (today/evening/tomorrow/date), deadline
- Project, area, tags, checklist items
- Heading within a project

## Error handling
- "task not found": Invalid task_id — search or list to get valid IDs
- "project not found": Project doesn't exist — list projects first
- Things 3 not running: The app may need to be launched
- Binary not found: Install things CLI via the Pawz skill installer

## Best practices
- Use `things today` to show the user's current focus
- Add tasks to appropriate projects rather than leaving everything in Inbox
- Include deadlines for time-sensitive tasks
- Use tags for cross-project categorization
- Show upcoming and overdue tasks proactively
