text = """
You can send WhatsApp messages using the `wacli` CLI binary.

## Sending messages
- `wacli send "+1234567890" "Hello!"` — send a text message
- `wacli send "+1234567890" "Hello!" --media photo.jpg` — send with image
- `wacli send "+1234567890" "Document" --media report.pdf` — send with document
- `wacli send --group "Family" "Hello everyone!"` — send to a group

## Reading messages
- `wacli read "+1234567890"` — read recent messages from a contact
- `wacli read "+1234567890" --count 20` — read last 20 messages
- `wacli read --group "Work"` — read group messages
- `wacli unread` — list conversations with unread messages

## Contacts & groups
- `wacli contacts` — list all contacts
- `wacli groups` — list all groups
- `wacli search "John"` — search contacts by name

## Status
- `wacli status` — check connection status

## Error handling
- "not connected": Re-link WhatsApp via QR code — `wacli link`
- "contact not found": Use full international phone number format (+country code)
- "group not found": List groups to find the exact name
- "media too large": WhatsApp limits: 16 MB for media, 100 MB for documents
- Binary not found: Install wacli via the Pawz skill installer

## Best practices
- Use international phone number format (+1234567890)
- Confirm recipient before sending messages
- Keep messages concise — WhatsApp is a chat platform
- Check unread messages when asked about new messages
- For groups, use exact group name as shown in `wacli groups`
