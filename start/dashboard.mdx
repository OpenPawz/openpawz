## Quick actions

The dashboard provides one-click access to common tasks:

- **New chat** — start a conversation with any agent
- **New task** — create a task and assign it to an agent
- **New automation** — set up a cron job or event trigger
- **Quick settings** — jump to provider or channel configuration

## Inbox

If you have email configured, the dashboard shows unread emails with quick reply. Agents can triage, summarize, and draft responses.

## Customization

The dashboard adapts to your workspace profile. Different profiles (Full, Light, Operator, Channel, Dev, Trader) show different widget layouts. You can toggle views and rearrange the workspace in **Settings → Workspace**.
