# Nextcloud

Connect to Nextcloud Talk so users on your Nextcloud instance can chat with Pawz agents. Like Mattermost, Nextcloud is self-hosted — your conversations never leave your server.

## Setup

1. Create a dedicated bot user on your Nextcloud instance (admin panel → **Users**)
2. Generate an **app password** for the bot user (user settings → **Security → Devices & sessions**)
3. In Pawz, go to **Settings → Channels**
4. Select **Nextcloud**
5. Enter:
   - **Server URL** — e.g., `https://cloud.yourcompany.com`
   - **Username** — Nextcloud bot user
   - **Password** — app password (not the main password)
6. Start the channel

## Configuration

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Server URL | Yes | Nextcloud instance URL |
| Username | Yes | Bot account username |
| Password | Yes | App password for the bot account |
| DM policy | Yes | Who can message the bot (open, allowlist, or pairing) |
| Allowed users | For allowlist | Nextcloud usernames |

## How it works

Pawz polls the Nextcloud Talk API for new messages. When a message arrives in a conversation the bot has joined, it's processed through the agent pipeline — prompt injection scan → agent routing → response → reply posted back to the conversation.

## Features

- **Nextcloud Talk conversations and DMs** — the bot participates in any conversation it's invited to
- **Group conversations** — the bot can respond in group chats when mentioned or when DM policy allows
- **Per-user sessions** with persistent memory across conversations
- **Prompt injection scanning** on all incoming messages
- **Agent routing** via channel routing rules
- **Channel-specific context** — lean context for fast, affordable responses

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Authentication fails | Use an **app password**, not the user's main password. Generate one in user settings → Security. |
| Bot doesn't see messages | Invite the bot user to the Talk conversation first |
| Connection refused | Verify the server URL is correct and includes `https://`. Check that Nextcloud Talk is enabled. |
| Slow responses | Nextcloud Talk uses polling (not WebSocket). Response time depends on poll interval. |

## Tips

:::tip
- **Always use an app password** instead of the main account password — it's more secure and can be revoked independently.
- **The bot joins conversations when invited** — add it to specific Talk rooms via the Nextcloud UI.
- **Ideal for organizations already on Nextcloud** — no additional infrastructure needed, just add a bot user.
